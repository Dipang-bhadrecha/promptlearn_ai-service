      "content": "CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It's a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG). Think of it as the makeup and wardrobe for your website.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Cascading:** This refers to the order in which styles are applied. Styles can be defined in different places (browser defaults, external stylesheets, inline styles), and the \"cascade\" determines which rules take precedence.\n\n*   **Style Sheets:** These are collections of rules that specify how elements on a web page should be displayed. Each rule consists of a selector (which targets specific HTML elements) and one or more declarations (which specify the styling).\n\n**In simpler terms:**\n\nHTML provides the *structure* of a webpage (content, headings, paragraphs, images, etc.). CSS provides the *style* of that webpage (colors, fonts, layout, spacing, etc.).\n\n**Key functions of CSS:**\n\n*   **Control visual presentation:** CSS allows you to control the color, font, size, spacing, layout, and other visual aspects of your web pages.\n*   **Separate content from presentation:** By separating the HTML (content) from the CSS (styling), you can easily update the look and feel of your website without modifying the underlying content. This makes website maintenance and redesign much easier.\n*   **Improve accessibility:** CSS can be used to improve the accessibility of your website for users with disabilities, for example, by providing alternative stylesheets for screen readers.\n*   **Responsive Design:** CSS Media Queries enable your website to adapt its layout and style to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, phones).\n*   **Create consistent look and feel:** Using CSS, you can apply the same styles across multiple pages, ensuring a consistent brand identity.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```css\n/* This CSS rule styles all paragraph elements */\np {\n  color: blue;        /* Sets the text color to blue */\n  font-family: Arial; /* Sets the font to Arial */\n  font-size: 16px;    /* Sets the font size to 16 pixels */\n}\n```\n\nThis CSS code would make all `<p>` (paragraph) elements on a webpage have blue text, use the Arial font, and have a font size of 16 pixels.\n\n**Where to put CSS:**\n\nCSS can be added to a webpage in three main ways:\n\n1.  **Inline Styles:** Directly within HTML elements using the `style` attribute. (e.g., `<p style=\"color: blue;\">This is a paragraph.</p>`). Not recommended for large projects, as it mixes content and presentation.\n\n2.  **Internal Styles:** Inside a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of an HTML document. (Good for small, page-specific styling).\n\n3.  **External Stylesheets:** In separate `.css` files, linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>`. (The best practice for maintainability and reusability). For example:\n\n    ```html\n    <head>\n      <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n    </head>\n    ```\n\n**In summary, CSS is essential for web development because it allows you to style your HTML content and create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.**\n",
